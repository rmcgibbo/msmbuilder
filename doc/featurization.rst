Featurization
=============

Many algorithms require that the input data be vectors in a (euclidean)
vector space. This includes :class:`~msmbuilder.cluster.KMeans` clustering,
:class:`~msmbuilder.decomposition.tICA`, and others.

Since there's usually no special rotational or translational reference
frame in a MD simulation, it's often desirable to remove rotational and
translational motion via featurization that is insensitive to rotations and
translations.

Alternative to Featurization
----------------------------

Many algorithms require vectorizable data. Other algorithms only require a
pairwise distance metric, e.g. RMSD between two protein conformations. In
general, you can define a pairwise distance among vectorized data, but you
cannot embed data into a vector space only from pairwise distance.

Some :ref:`clustering <cluster>` methods let you use an arbitrary distance
metric, including RMSD. In this case, the input to ``fit()`` may be a list
of MD trajectories instead of a list of numpy arrays. Clustering methods
that allow this currently include :class:`~msmbuilder.cluster.KCenters` and
:class:`~msmbuilder.cluster.KMedoids`.
