Examples
========

The following examples should give you an idea of how to use MSMBuilder in
practice. Since MSMBuilder is both an application and Python library,
analysis can be performed either via the command line or in Python. 

The Python API examples can be run interactively in Jupyter (IPython)
notebook. Download the `notebook files
<https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder/tree/master/examples>`_ and open
them in Jupyter
