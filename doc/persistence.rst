Datasets and Persistence
========================

MSMBuilder has utility functions for persisting data (loading and saving).
The two types of objects to be persisted on disk are datasets and models. 

Datasets
--------

In MSMBuilder, a ``dataset`` is a collection of timeseries, or "sequences".
Each timeseries usually represents a single molecular
dynamics trajectory, and may be represented in a number of different
formats

- A sequence may be an instance of ``mdtraj.Trajectory``, a molecular
  dynamics trajectory object.

- A sequence may be a ``numpy`` 2D array with shape ``n_frames x
  n_features``, representing the projection of each frame in molecular
  dynamics trajectory into some vector space of dimension
  :math:`\mathbb{R}^{n_{features}}`. The leading dimension with length
  ``n_frames`` indexes over the timeseries. For example,
  `featurization<featurization>` takes a list of trajectories and returns a
  list of feature arrays.

- A sequence may be an integer-valued 1D array with shape ``n_frames``.
  For example, `clustering<clustering>` takes a list of feature arrays and
  returns a list of sequences of state indices.


Datasets on Disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MSMBuilder can read and write datasets to and from disk (resp) in two
formats: ``hdf5`` and ``dir-npy``. From the Python API, you must choose
which format to write. The command-line application chooses the most
sensible option for you.

With HDF5, the dataset containing all of the trajectories is contained in a
single file on disk. This is generally the most convenient, but can be
unwieldy for large datasets. The transformed output of ``msmb tICA``,
``msmb PCA``, and clustering commands are stored in HDF5 format.

The ``dir-npy`` format stores the dataset as a collection of uncompressed
numpy ``.npy`` files in a directory on disk. This is the most suitable for
large datasets, because it enables features like memory-mapped IO. The
transformed output of ``msmb`` Featurizer commands are stored in
``dir-npy`` format.


Trajectory Datasets - Read only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trajectory datasets are loaded using MDTraj. This requires specifying a
`glob <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29>`_ pattern for
the trajectories, as well as the topology. MSMBuilder does not write
trajectory datasets.
 

Provenance Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When msmbuilder saves a dataset, it also saves information which can be
used to trace the provenance of the dataset.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ msmb AtomPairsFeaturizer --out atom_pairs  --trjs '*.dcd'  --pair_indices atom_indices.txt  --top top.pdb

    [...]

    $ ls atom_pairs

Models
------

MSMBuilder models can be losslessly persisted to disk using Python's pickle
infrastructure. We recommend using the functions
:func:`msmbuilder.utils.load` and :func:`msmbuilder.utils.dump` to load and
save models respectively. The pickle format is not secure against malicious
attacks. Don't load MSMBuilder models from untrusted sources.
