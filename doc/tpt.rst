Transition Path Theory
======================


Transition path theory (TPT) is a way to extract the highest-flux pathways
of your system from an estimated MSM.

These are some canonical references for TPT. Note that TPT is really a
specialization of ideas very familiar to the mathematical study of Markov
chains, and there are many books, manuscripts in the mathematical
literature that cover the same concepts.
